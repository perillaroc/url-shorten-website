A simple website for url shortening
===============
-----

Intorduction
------------

Source for my small shortening url project on [Sina SAE](http://urlshorten.sinaapp.com/ "http://urlshorten.sinaapp.com/").

I currently implement short url services provided by [Google](http://goo.ly/ "http://goo.ly/"), [Baidu](http://dwz.cn/ "http://dwz.cn/") and [Bitly](https://bitly.com/ "https://bitly.com/"), whose short url api is easy to use. In their api,  authentication is not needed to shorten long urls and expand short urls created by them.

Future Work
-------------

I'm going to invole more short url services in my website,such as Sina and Tecent. But unlike those services methiond above,these two require an user to log in for using short url api.Although it's more difficulty for me to add login moudles for different websites, I'll try my best to bring a completely new website.

History
---------------
I worked on this small project in this May.After the first version released on the end of May,I'd forgotten this project untill I found my code for tencent short url api went wrong in mid-August.So it's time for me to continue this project.

Remember:

**Time waits for no man.**
